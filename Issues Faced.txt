This file contains some of the issue I have faced while creating this project.

1. ng build issue:
This is rather silly issue, when i was trying to run the build using the build command, I faced the issue below.
command ran: "ng build --output-path docs --base-href/my-portfolio"
error on the terminal:  "Error: Unknown argument: base-href/my-portfolio"
So the solution is that we need to keep the space after the href in the command
href/<repo name> is wrong
href /<repo name> is correct.
Below is the stackoverflow link for my answer with issue and images.

2. Build error issue: 
When I was trying to build my project for external build, i.e, on the guthub pages, I came accross this issue 
" Error: Optimization error [main.64ac3ee7acfe838b.js]: Error: The service was stopped"
with this my application was not compiling properly, and when i commit the changes to github, the workflow failed.
To solve this issue I have did research using stack overflow and found a similar issue, regarding the build.
After performing the changes, my application ran perfectly and was able to commit changes to the github pages successfully.
below is my answer on the stackoverflow
